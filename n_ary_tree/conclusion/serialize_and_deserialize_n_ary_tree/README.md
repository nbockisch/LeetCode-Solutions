Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
* The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
* Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.

* [c++](serialize_and_deserialize_n_ary_tree.cpp)
