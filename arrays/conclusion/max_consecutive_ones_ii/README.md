# Prompt
Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most one_ `0`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the maximum number of consecutive 1s. After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

# Solution
* [c++](max_consecutive_ones_ii.cpp)
